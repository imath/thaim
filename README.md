thaim is imath's theme!
=======================

This is my first WordPress theme (plz be kind). My goal was to build a theme for my blog, so there may be behaviors that you won't like. But i thought some of you might be interested in using some of its features.
You can browse the demo of this theme on my [personal blog](http://imathi.eu)
thaim is available in french and english. 


some extra features..
=====================


thaim_code
----------

It's a shortcode to prettify your snippets. As thaim is disabling the WYSIWIG editor, you'll find a quicktag in the regular text editor to launch the thaim_code editor.
You'll then be able to paste your code in your post or to add the raw an regular url of one of your gist or github file.


thaim maintenance page
----------------------

Sometimes we need to finish some work on our blog, that's why i've added this feature. Blog admin will be able to browse his website, other users will see a simple maintenance message.


BuddyPress solo!
----------------

Use the member's page to replace the author page.


Configuration needed
--------------------

+ WordPress 3.6
+ BuddyPress 2.0
