thaim is imath's theme!
=======================

This WP Theme is no more maintained and is now archived.

This is my first WordPress theme (plz be kind). My goal was to build a theme for my blog, so there may be behaviors that you won't like. But i thought some of you might be interested in using some of its features.
You can browse the demo of this theme on my [personal blog](http://imathi.eu)
thaim is available in french and english.


Configuration needed
--------------------

+ WordPress 4.5
